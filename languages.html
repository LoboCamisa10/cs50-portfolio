                    Here I will briefly talk about my knowledge and experiences with languages:

                    The first time I had contact with the language was during the CS50 - Harvard course. I spent a good amount of time using the language, even though it's not my biggest specialty.</p></section>

                    This was my first programming language, studying Python with a great teacher, Guanabara from the "Curso em VÃ­deo" channel,and possibly my best language where I did more than 100 exercises in the language.</p></section>

                    I got to know the language on the DIO course (Digital Innovation One), where I learned the basics and I also saw it on Harvard's CS50 course, it is currently the language in which I program most, and I plan to improve as much as possible in it.

                    A language that despite its simplicity and not being considered a programming language, I liked its style and way of using it, my contact with it also took place on the CS50 course at Harvard and at DIO (Digital Innovation One).

                    A stylization "language" that despite its simplicity, I also really like handling stylization through it. I encountered this language through the CS50 course at Harvard and DIO, but I constantly watch other people's videos to learn more about it.
