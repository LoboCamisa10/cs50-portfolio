                    &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a lover of challenges, especially those that take me out of my comfort zone, as that's where my greatest learning experiences arise.I´ve been and still am a huge fan of games, especially those with competitiveness involved, and it's precisely because of my highly competitive nature that I´ve reached really high levels within countless games among the most famous ones.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not a regular user of social media, I´ve distanced myself from most of them over 5 years ago. Currently, I engage in weightlifting and I'm training to gain more flexibility in my body, this helps me to keep me more relaxed, focused and in peace.

                    When I first encountered the world of programming in 2021, I didn't give it much thought but in a casual manner towards the end of 2023, I decided to give the field another shot. Now, with just 6 months of involvement, I'm hooked. I've become a greedy student of the field, to the extent that on holidays and weekends, I find myself seeking out content on the subject, where I discovered that my fluency in English perfectly aligns with the pursuit of new knowledge. Beyond that, nowadays I'm reading books of self development.
