# My Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website repository! ðŸš€

This project is a showcase of my work as a web designer and developer. The main goal of this site is to serve as a space to experiment, improve my design skills, and share a little bit about myself.

âš  **Note:** This site was developed with an exclusive focus on desktop browsers, with no adaptation for mobile devices.

## Objectives
- Explore and refine visual design and user experience (UX) concepts.
- Experiment with different styles, layouts, and interactions.
- Create a unique digital identity that reflects my personal and professional style.

Feel free to explore the code and share suggestions!
